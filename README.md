## Abstract

With the vigorous development of multimedia equipment and applications, efficient retrieval of large-scale multi-modal data has become a trendy research topic. Thereinto, hashing has become a prevalent choice due to its retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. Although multi-modal hashing has drawn lots of attention in recent years, there still remain some problems. The first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this paper, we propose a new model, termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS). We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data, which could help handle the new coming classes, and thereby
construct the enhanced semantic objective function. An efficient and effective discrete online optimization algorithm is further proposed for OASIS. Extensive experiments show that our method can exceed the state-of-the-art models. For good reproducibility and benefiting the community, our code and data are already available in supplementary material and will be made publicly available.

## Results

Map results (16 bit) of OASIS in three online settings defined in our paper.

|      Settings      | MIRFlickr | NUS-WIDE |
| :----------------: | :-------: | :------: |
| **First setting**  |  0.8558   |  0.7742  |
| **Second setting** |  0.7833   |  0.7931  |
| **Third setting**  |  0.1595   |  0.1211  |

## Notes

- We have generated the word2vec vectors corresponding to MIRFlickr and NUS-WIDE and placed them with our data. Therefore, no additional generation is required. If you want to generate the word embeddings yourself, we also include the label names in the data.
- The results of the MAP results are different for the two versions on arvix. Because we modified the way we divided the data in the second and third settings and then reran all the experiments. In addition, we repeated experiments several times and took the average results in the second version.
- The code of the baselines can be obtained from the link below.
